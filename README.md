# brownomics

A DApp that helps Web3 projects test their tokenomics before going live

The simulation core features for the Brownomics project were designed and implemented in the [pybrownomics](https://github.com/LorenzoTomaz/pybrownomics) repository during the [superhack](https://ethglobal.com/events/superhack) ETHGlobal hackathon.
